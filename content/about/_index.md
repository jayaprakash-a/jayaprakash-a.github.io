Hey! My name is Jayaprakash Akula and I am a Software Developer. I am Computer Science post-graduate from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay with my thesis in multi-modal learning area. I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in 2019 with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I am a decent coder and programmer.

I am cricket enthusiast and try not to miss any opportunity to enjoy the game. I am not involved in cricket fan wars but a simple fan who enjoys the game:sweat_smile:. If anyone wants to connect with me or want to know me more reach out on LinkedIn or drop in a mail. Would be very happy to get in touch with you.
