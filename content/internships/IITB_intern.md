Xcos is a Scilab tool dedicated to the modeling and simulation of hybrid dynamic systems including both continuous and discrete models. 
<!--more-->

It also allows simulating systems governed by explicit equations (causal simulation) and implicit equations (a causal simulation). Xcos includes a graphical editor which allows to easily represent models as block diagrams by connecting the blocks to each other. Each block represents a predefined basic function or a user-defined one. This blocks can be selected from a window called palette browser.

Xcos on web is a project to port the core functionalities of Xcos to a browser-only version that can be used without installing additional plug-ins or software on the cloud.

#### **Responsibilities :**


- Helped in creating a web version of Xcos, a Scilab application
- Developed a module that enables two way communication for tkscale block.
- Successful real time communication with no/minimal latency.
- **Technologies:** Python, JavaScript, C and Fortran
