#### **Responsibilities :**

- Investigating various techniques to learn joint audio-visual-linguistic embedding for video-text retrieval
- Inspecting new losses that can help improve the performance
- Exploring various heuristics to form augmented supervision required for new loss for better ranking of videos given text query and vice versa
- Implement retrieval task with different losses in MSRVTT, Charades and TFT dataset
- **Technologies:** Python and PyTorch
