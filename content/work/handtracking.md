The project involves predicting accurate 3D hand positions in world space using multiple cameras including monochrome fisheye cameras and depth ToF sensor.

We have developed a sophisticated hand tracking system that begins with detecting hand positions in multi-view grayscale images. This involves using a Kalman Filter for tracking and refining the detection process with Non-Maximal Suppression to eliminate overlapping bounding boxes. By addressing false positives, false negatives, and partial hand detections, we significantly improved the modelâ€™s precision and recall, ensuring accurate hand position tracking.

For hand-keypoint estimation, we trained a model to identify specific hand features within the detected bounding boxes. We experimented with various architectures and added biomechanical constraints to filter out unrealistic poses, enhancing robustness. Additionally, we implemented a real-time visualization system that triangulates 2D keypoints from multiple sensors to compute 3D joint positions using an SVD-based minimization algorithm. This allows for precise and real-time tracking of hand movements in three dimensions, providing a detailed representation of hand gestures.
